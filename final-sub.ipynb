We beleive that these parameters may increase more our accuracy but unfortunately we could not.\n","​\n","After we get the result, we found that balancing the data before training was a good idea, but it was too late for us since we noticed that after we had trained a lot of models with unbalanced data, and for training all the models again will takes a lot of time. For sure in the next projects we are going to balance the data from the begining.\n","​\n","This project allowed us to apply the theoretical knowledge we have learned to deal with practical problems and deal with real data. Compared with simulated data, we need to try more methods for this kind of real data and do more parameter learning to achieve a good effect. So for real data, especially massive data, it takes a long time to select and optimize our model.\n","​\n","Finally we ended with an accuracy of 94%."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
