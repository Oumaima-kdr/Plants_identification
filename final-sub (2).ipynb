Optimizer\nWe compared two of the most popular optimizers, ADAM and SGD, we found that ADAM had given a better accuracy than SGD (training accuracy = 0.049 for efficientnet_b0 in the first epoch, while it gives 0.754 for the same model, same epoch, with ADAM), so we chose ADAM as the optimizer.\n#### 2.1.2. Criterion\nThe loss crieterion chosen is the negative log likelihood in PyTorch.\n#### 2.1.3. Batch size\nFirst we tried all the models with a batch size = 32, then we had increased it to 64, which gives almost better accuracies, we also tried batch_size = 128, but our machines were not able to do it because of a memory issue, so we kept the batch size 64.\n#### 2.1.4. Learning rate\nLearning rate is very important for an optimizer,the final goal is to acheive the global minimum of the loss function.\nWe tried the learning rate of 0.01,0.001 and 0.0001 as the starter learning rate. For the first one the result is very unstable and often can't get a loss that low enough. The learning rate 0.001 and 0.0001 have almost the same performance, but 0.001 are faster than 0.0001,so we choose the 0.001 as the learning rate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.2.

Conclusion\nNow, let's review the process of our project.\n​\nFirst, we used the materials we have learned and many others online, to be able to classify the plant images the better way. \n​\nTo do that we tried different models from the PyTorch library suitable for image classification, and for that we learned so much. \nWhile exploring the data we found that it was too large, so we tried the data augmentation, but when we applied the efficientnet model on the training set, we didn't notice a great change in the accuracy, neither with the googlenet model, so we continued without the augmentation.\n​\nThen we have studied and tested the models function and the different parameter settings in each one.\n​\nWe faced a real problem with the memory, so a model like Xception did not be able to run, same for a large number of epochs and larger batch size. We beleive that these parameters may increase more our accuracy but unfortunately we could not.\n​\nAfter we get the result, we found that balancing the data before training was a good idea, but it was too late for us since we noticed that after we had trained a lot of models with unbalanced data, and for training all the models again will takes a lot of time. For sure in the next projects we are going to balance the data from the begining.\n​\nThis project allowed us to apply the theoretical knowledge we have learned to deal with practical problems and deal with real data. Compared with simulated data, we need to try more methods for this kind of real data and do more parameter learning to achieve a good effect. So for real data, especially massive data, it takes a long time to select and optimize our model.\n​\nFinally we ended with an accuracy of 94%.","metadata":{}}]}
